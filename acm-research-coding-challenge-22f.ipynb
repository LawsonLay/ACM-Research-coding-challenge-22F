Ford F150)\n* Large Size\n* Imported\n* Old Age (Discontinued)\n\nWhile a proper research into this topic might go something like:\n*To what extent does a car's attributes affect a driver's likelihood to be in a accident?*\n\nWhich could have a theoretical counter-argument stating that it is mostly the driver's own fault for most vehicular accidents.\n\nHowever, that's not the goal today, so one quick Google search of \"Accident-prone cars\", and here we are now.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport copy\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/carsforsale/cars_raw.csv\")\n\ndf.info()","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-06T03:59:03.105180Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-06T03:59:03.105632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-06T03:59:03.222070Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-06T03:59:03.105597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-06T03:59:03.220799Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the CarsForSale spreadsheet, the columns which meet or are related to our aforementioned accident-prone attributes are as follows:\n* Reliability Rating\n* Mileage\n* -Transmission-\n* -Engine-\n* Performance Rating\n* Price\n* Year\n* Make\n* Used/New\n* Deal Type\n*Transmission and Engine omitted due to added parsing complexity.*\n\nNow with our interesting columns defined, the next step is to determine how being more accident-prone will be visualized.\nFor time-crunch sake, a simple \"accident-prone\" score calculated by some makeshift algorithm will be used. A list of the top 10 accident prone cars will be printed out along with their \"accident-prone\" score.\n\nTo create a accident-prone score, the different attributes of a car must be weighted against each other in their \"accident-prone\"-ness.\nAccording to the four article's ratings on most accident prone cars, what the most accident-prone cars have in common are their type. Specifically, them being of sport or luxury type. Second is affordability therefore availability. If more people can buy a car, the car will be more common on the streets, therefore more common to be in an accident. Then the third factor this program will look at is age, since another common factor is old age of the vehicle.\n\nThe columns can then be split into three main score factors divided into subfactors:\n> Type\n* Make\n* Performance Rating\n\n> Accessibility\n* Price\n* Deal Type\n\n> Age\n* Reliability Rating\n* Year\n* Used/New\n* Mileage\n\nNote that accessibility is referring to the ability of many people to access or buy the car.\n\nThe main three factors don't contradict each other, so a high level look at the score algorithm could look like the following with weights:\n\n**ACCIDENT PRONE SCORE = (0.60)TYPE + (0.40)ACCESS + (0.20)AGE**\n \nThen define the subfactors:\n\n**TYPE = MAKE + PERFORMANCE_RATING**\n\n**ACCESS = DEAL TYPE - PRICE**\n\n**AGE = YEAR + USED_NEW + MILEAGE - RELIABILITY_RATING**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"numOfRows = len(df.index)\nAPS_list = []\nAPS_list_sorted = []\ntopTenAPS = []\n\n#https://peplifestyle.com/luxury-car-brands-ranked-by-prestige/\nluxlist1 = [\"Ferrari\", \" Lamborghini\", \"Maserati\", \"Bentley\", \"Porsche\", \"Jaguar\", \"Land\", \"Mercedes-Benz\", \"Tesla\", \"BMW\", \"Audi\", \"Lexus\"]\nluxlist2 = [\"Cadillac\", \"INFINITI\", \"Acura\", \"Alfa\"]\nluxlist3 = [\"Lincoln\", \"Buick\", \"Volvo\", \"Chrysler\", \"Hyundai\", \"Volkswagen\", \"MINI\", \"Kia\"]\n\nfor x in range(numOfRows):\n    #Car Type Factor\n    \n    #Make sub-score\n    if df.iloc[x]['Make'] in luxlist1:\n        make = 100\n    elif df.iloc[x]['Make'] in luxlist2:\n        make = 60\n    elif df.iloc[x]['Make'] in luxlist3:\n        make = 30\n    else:\n        make = 0\n    \n    #Performance Rating sub-score\n    performance_rating = df.iloc[x]['PerformanceRating']\n    \n    #Car Type Score\n    carType = make + (performance_rating * 20)\n    \n    \n    #Car Access Factor\n    \n    #Price sub-score\n    price = df.iloc[x]['Price']\n    if price == \"Not Priced\":\n        price = 0\n    else:\n        price = price.replace('$','')\n        price = price.replace(',','')\n        price = int(price)\n        price = price / 1000\n    \n    #Deal Type sub-score\n    if df.iloc[x]['DealType'] == \"Great\":\n        deal_type = 100\n    elif df.iloc[x]['DealType'] == \"Good\":\n        deal_type = 60\n    elif df.iloc[x]['DealType'] == \"Fair\":\n        deal_type = 30\n    else:\n        deal_type = 0\n    \n    #Car Access Score\n    carAccess = deal_type - price\n    \n    \n    #Car Age Factor\n    \n    #Reliability Rating sub-score\n    reliability_rating = df.iloc[x]['ReliabilityRating']\n    reliability_rating = reliability_rating * 20\n    \n    #Year sub-score\n    year = 2022 - df.iloc[x]['Year']\n    year = year * 10\n    \n    #Used/New sub-score\n    if \"Used\" in df.iloc[x]['Used/New']:\n        used_new = 30\n    else:\n        used_new = 0\n        \n    #Mileage sub-score\n    mileage = df.iloc[x]['Mileage']\n    mileage = mileage / 1000\n    \n    #Car Age Score\n    carAge = year + used_new + mileage - reliability_rating\n    \n    \n    #Car Accident-prone Score\n    carAPS = (0.6 * carType) + (0.4 * carAccess) + (0.2 * carAge)\n    carAPS = int(carAPS)\n    APS_list.append(carAPS)\n\nAPS_list_sorted = copy.deepcopy(APS_list)\nAPS_list_sorted.sort()\n\nfor y in range(10):\n    index = APS_list.index(APS_list_sorted[len(APS_list)-y-1])\n    topTenAPS.append(df.iloc[index])\n\nprint(topTenAPS)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-06T04:07:44.670627Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-06T04:07:44.671054Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-06T04:07:59.877659Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-06T04:07:44.671021Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-06T04:07:59.875956Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From this algorithm, the conclusion is that the most accident prone cars from the dataset are:\n\n1. 2005 Used Lexus ES 330 Base (A5)\n2. 2003 Used Mercedes-Benz SL-Class SL500 Roadster\n3. 2010 Used BMW 535 i\n4. 2005 Used Porsche Cayenne S\n5. 2008 Used Lexus RX 350 Base\n6. 2008 Used Mercedes Benz S-Class S 550 4MATIC\n7. 2011 Used BMW 328 i xDrive\n\n*Omitted duplicates*","metadata":{}}]}
